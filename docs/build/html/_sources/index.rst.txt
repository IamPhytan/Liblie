LibLie
======
**LibLie** is a small lib containing utils functions for matrix operations on the special orthogonal group SO(3), the special euclidian group SE(3) and their respective lie algebras.

The notations are based on the book "State estimation for robotics" by Tim Barfoot.
If you did not read it yet, read it.
The book is available to download on his `website <http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/~tdb/>`_.

You can also download an awesome `cheatsheet about the basics of Lie algebra <https://norlab.ulaval.ca/research/LieCheatsheet/>`_.
